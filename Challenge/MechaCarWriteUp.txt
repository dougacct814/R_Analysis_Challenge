MPG Regression
Summary:
.	Create a new RScript in your R source pane and save it to your active directory. Name this new RScript file MechaCarChallenge.RScript.
.	Download the MechaCar mpg dataset and place it in your active directory for your R session.
.	Using multiple linear regression, design a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using a number of variables within the MechaCar mpg dataset. Create a separate text file called MechaCarWriteUp.txt. In the text file, provide a small writeup of your interpretation of the multiple linear regression results. 
Detailed Results:
.	Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
o	Vehicle Length
o	Ground Clearance
.	Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
o	If we find that the slope of the regression line is significantly different from zero, we will conclude that there is a significant relationship between the independent and dependent variables.  In reviewing the data set, the linear model is not considered to be zero as there is not a flat line with a slope of 0.
.	Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
o	Yes, this linear model does predict the mpg prototypes effectively.


Suspension Coil Summary
.	Download the suspension coil testPreview the document result dataset and place it in your active directory for your R session.
.	In the same MechaCarChallenge.RScript file, create a summary statistics table for the suspension coil's pounds-per-inch continuous variable.
.	Be sure to include the following metrics:
o	Mean
o	Median
o	Variance
o	Standard deviation
Using the same MechaCarWriteUp.txt text file, provide a short write-up of your interpretation and findings for the suspension coil summary statistics. Be sure to include the following details:
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification? Why or why not?
-	It does not as there are results that exceed the 100 pounds per square inch (lot 3 of 170)


Suspension Coil T-Test
.	Using the same suspension coil data and the MechaCarChallenge.RScript file, determine if the suspension coil's pound-per-inch results are statistically different from the mean population results of 1,500 pounds per inch. (Hint: Refer to the t-test section of this module to determine which statistical test to use.)
.	In the MechaCarWriteUp.txt text file, provide a small writeup of your interpretation and findings for the t-test results.

-	No, the specs are relatively similar and the suspension coils pound per inch are not statistically different from the mean population results of 1,500 pounds per inch.


Design Your Own Study
Upper management is looking for your expertise and wants you to design a study that compares the performance of the MechaCar prototype vehicle to other comparable vehicles on the market. In the MechaCarWriteUp.txt text file, write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar outperforms the competition. In your study design, be sure to write about the following considerations:
.	Think critically about what metrics you would think would be of interest to a consumer (cost, fuel efficiency, color options, etc.).
.	Determine what question we would ask, what the null and alternative hypothesis would be to answer that question, and what statistical test could be used to test this hypothesis.
.	Knowing what test should be used, what data should be collected?

Our recommendation would be to collect the estimated base package cost, fuel efficiency, and lifespan to determine it the 

Our null hypothesis would be to state that the cost of a mechaCarhs no bearing on the mpg.  The alternative hypothesis would be that the higher cost usually decreases the mpg for higher cost vehicles as the add-ons and larger vehicles cost more and reduce efficiency.  We would need to have datasets for the overall estimated costs of vehicles and their average real-time MPG data sets.
